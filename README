NAME

    Locale::Maketext::Lexicon::Getcontext - PO file parser for Maketext


DESCRIPTION

    This module is a very experimental fork/variant of
    Locale::Maketext::Lexicon::Gettext where messages are fetched by their
    "msgctxt" instead of their "msgid". It is currently mostly developed to
    help the I18N of OpenFoodFacts <http://openfoodfacts.org/> and
    OpenBeautyFacts <http://openbeautyfacts.org/>. You probably don't
    want to use this, unless you really now what your are doing.
